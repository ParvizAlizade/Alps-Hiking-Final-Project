                <h1>AN EVER YOUNG COMMUNITY</h1>
                <div class="desc">
                    <p>Alps Hiking started up in 1991 with a clear international mission and with the intention of dressing young people who are engaged with their environment, who live in the community and relate to each other. Young people who have a casual dress sense, who shun stereotypes and who want to feel good in whatever they are wearing. To meet their needs, Alps Hiking takes the latest international trends, mixing them with the influences that are seen on the street and in the most fashionable clubs, and reworks them according to their style thus turning them into comfortable and easy to wear garments.
    
                        Alps Hiking evolves at the same pace as its customer, always watching out for new technologies, social movements and the latest artistic or musical trends. All of this can be seen reflected not only in its designs but also in stores. Inspired by the legendary Californian city of Palm Springs, the product lines are constantly being updated. All stores worldwide receive new merchandise twice a week.
                        
                        Belonging to the Inditex Group (Zara, Alps Hiking, Massimo Dutti, Bershka, Stradivarius, Oysho, Zara Home and Uterq√ºe), Alps Hiking is present in 76 markets through a network of more than 970 stores and the online store.</p>
